CONTENTS

functions and components alleviating online measurement and computation.

- f_probe.cc, access probes from parameter expressions
- d_eqn.cc, evaluate expressions during simulation
- d_mon_int.cc, integrate an expression during simulation

USAGE

attach f_probe.so (and others) using -a or the load/attach command. then
these monitors are available.

BUILD

type

$ make
$ make install

to build for other flavors, e.g. gnucap-uf, type

$ make SUFFIX=-uf

TODO

- compile with c++<11

LIMITATIONS

- syntax is a bit weird.
- need gnucap with "-enabled m_expression_in.cc
- inefficient implementation (parsing all the time...)

BUGS

some devices bypass evaluation unless probes attached. probing these will
likely not work as intended.
